# Installs the built app onto a chosen play.dhis2.org demo instance via
# DHIS2's standard, documented App Management API (POST /api/apps) -- the
# same install mechanism used for any manual DHIS2 app install, nothing
# app-hub-specific or undocumented.
#
# Wrapped as a script because play.dhis2.org instances are periodically
# reset/rebuilt by DHIS2, which wipes any installed app. Re-run this before
# sharing a demo link -- don't assume a previously-shared link is still live.
#
# Required environment variables:
#   PLAY_URL       Base URL of the RESOLVED play instance backend, e.g.
#                  https://play.im.dhis2.org/stable-2-43-1 -- NOT the
#                  play.dhis2.org/demo short alias. That alias 302-redirects
#                  ACROSS HOSTS to the real backend (currently
#                  play.im.dhis2.org), and curl correctly refuses to resend
#                  Basic Auth across a host change, so pointing this script at
#                  the alias silently installs nothing. Resolve it first:
#                    curl -sI https://play.dhis2.org/demo/   # follow `location` twice
#   PLAY_USERNAME  Username for that instance's published demo admin account
#   PLAY_PASSWORD  Password for that account
#
# Demo credentials for play.dhis2.org are published by DHIS2 itself
# (https://docs.dhis2.org) and can change over time -- verify before running
# this rather than assuming any specific value here. As of this writing they
# are admin / district.
