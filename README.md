[![Project status: early development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-early%20development-orange)](#project-status)

An open-source disease-surveillance, early-warning, and response platform for Bangladesh. The project is being developed incrementally from reproducible dengue, measles, and acute watery diarrhea research workflows.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is an early practice and research implementation. It is not a validated clinical tool, an official outbreak-definition system, or a production DHIS2 deployment.

## Vision

The target platform combines a customized public-health dashboard with DHIS2 as the health-data backend and independent services for ingestion, prediction, explainable alerts, and response recommendations.

```

DHIS2 integration and the customized frontend are part of the roadmap. The current milestone implements the reusable ingestion, surveillance, API, and alert foundation.

## Current capabilities

- Validates an existing daily dengue CSV export
- Aggregates observations into ISO epidemiological weeks
- Produces a normalized surveillance dataset with source provenance
- Detects partial reporting weeks and excludes them from alert calculations
- Generates explainable alerts using a four-week historical baseline
- Exposes FastAPI endpoints for diseases, trends, and latest alerts
- Includes automated tests and continuous integration

## Project status

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Dengue CSV ingestion | Implemented |
| Weekly surveillance data model | Implemented |
| Explainable baseline alerts | Implemented |
| FastAPI service | Implemented |
| Division-level surveillance | Planned |
| DHIS2 metadata and synchronization | Planned |
| Customized React dashboard | Planned |
| Measles integration | Planned |
| AWD/environmental-risk integration | Planned |
| Operational validation | Not started |

See the [roadmap](#roadmap) and [architecture documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the intended progression.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Git

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khalilurrrahmanridoykhan/onehealth-platform.git
cd onehealth-platform
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate the environment with `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`.

### Import dengue data

```bash
python scripts/import_dengue.py /path/to/dengue_daily_2026.csv
```

The importer expects:

```csv
date,dengue_cases_daily
2026-01-01,76
2026-01-02,63
```

Normalized output is written to `data/processed/dengue_weekly.csv`. Boundary weeks are retained for transparency, while incomplete weeks are excluded from alerts.

### Start the API

```bash
uvicorn onehealth.api:app --reload
```

- API: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>
- Interactive documentation: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>
- OpenAPI schema: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json>

### Available endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Service health and version |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/diseases` | Available diseases |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/trends/DENGUE` | Complete weekly dengue records |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/trends/DENGUE?complete_only=false&limit=10` | Include partial weeks and limit results |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/alerts/DENGUE/latest` | Latest explainable dengue alert |

## Alert interpretation

The practice algorithm compares the latest complete week with the mean of the previous four complete weeks.

| Current cases compared with baseline | Risk |
|---|---|
| Less than 120% | Low |
| 120% to less than 150% | Medium |
| 150% or more | High |

The result includes the observed and expected case counts, risk level, confidence heuristic, reasons, and recommended follow-up actions. These thresholds must be calibrated and validated before operational use.

## Testing

```bash
pytest
```

CI runs the test suite on supported Python versions for every push and pull request.

## Data provenance and privacy

The included demonstration dataset is derived from publicly accessible, aggregate DGHS Bangladesh dengue reporting. It contains no names, patient identifiers, or individual-level health records. Every normalized record retains its source name and URL.

Do not commit credentials, protected health information, or identifiable patient data. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for responsible reporting.

## Roadmap

1. Add division-level dengue ingestion and stable geographic codes.
2. Define DHIS2 organization units, data elements, programs, and mappings.
3. Implement authenticated DHIS2 synchronization and duplicate protection.
4. Build the customized React dashboard with trends, maps, and alerts.
5. Add EBS verification, risk assessment, investigation, and response workflows.
6. Integrate measles outbreak intelligence.
7. Integrate AWD, rainfall, and flood-risk indicators.
8. Validate alert methods with public-health experts before operational use.
